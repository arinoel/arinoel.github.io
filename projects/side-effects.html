        <p><em>Side Effects May Include</em> is one of three books of poetry that I designed as part of a book design and production course. The three books were designed as a series with similar cover designs and the same typography for all of the interiors. This book was designed to be read as a 9x6, due to the nature of the poems in chart form, but it has a standard cover for cohesion with the others in the series. This edition of <em>Side Effects</em> won a spot in the 2014 New England Book Show. (Note: This edition is a different edition than the one currently for sale.)</p>
