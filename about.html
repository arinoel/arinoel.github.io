	<h2>Hi, I'm Ari.</h2>
	<p class="about_me">I'm a publishing assistant at Bibliomotion books + media in Brookline, MA with a passion for beautiful books. I love working on book and magazine projects in my free time, especially ones with digital components. I recently earned my Master's in Publishing and Writing from Emerson College in Boston, MA. This website, in fact, was born out of an independent study project at Emerson and is the hand-coded culmination of a semesters' worth of research and working through courses on <a href="http://www.lynda.com">lynda.com</a>. In addition to web design and development, I've designed books, magazines, and eBooks as part of my coursework and have come away with a strong understanding of both 	print and digital production.
